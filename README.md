BeholderWeb v1.1 is our coolest tool so far, turning text prompts into images using Python + Big-Sleep. The images are strangely birdlike because our AI model is based on bird images. It's very easy to run because everyone likes happy tech.

We provide free AI assisted tools to create media, particularly of virtual tabletop role playing game (Dungeons & Dragons) Twitch streams. A great challenge in content production is making a short 10 minute YouTube video out of a 4 hour Twitch stream. We want to turn a 40 hour Twitch-to-Youtube video conversion and editing project into a 3 hour fun process of just clicking what the AI makes that you like.
