BeholderWeb v1.1 is our coolest tool so far, turning text prompts into images using Python + Big-Sleep. The images are strangely birdlike because our AI model is based on bird images. It's very easy to run because everyone likes happy tech.


Here's the Google Colab for D20bot BeholderWeb v1.1

We provide free AI assisted tools to create media, particularly of virtual tabletop role playing game (Dungeons & Dragons) Twitch streams. A great challenge in content production is making a short 10 minute YouTube video out of a 4 hour Twitch stream. We want to turn a 40 hour Twitch-to-Youtube video conversion and editing project into a 3 hour fun process of just clicking what the AI makes that you like.

D20bot LoreBard is using Amazon Web Services Transcribe and a few other tools to generate a big spreadsheet of everything that everyone said.

One of our sheets has 1,469 lines over 3 hours of spoken gameplay by a Dungeons & Dragons Twitch streamer, and there is an interface for marking content to keep/discard/highlight for future use.

Here's a Google Sheet of the Old Version

Here's an implementation of the OpenAI CLIP model that I want to use with images scraped from Google or somewhere else.
